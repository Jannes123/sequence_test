## Sequence code test
```bash
cmake . -B build/
cd build/
make
./Collies 100000000```

### Example output program two
```/build-12:55>./Collies 

 Enter the value of the upper limit : 40000

 40000 

Calculating Collatz: 
---
empirical guess of lower limit with longest sequence chain : 24000 
largest value in sequence :  41163712 
start :  35655 
steps :  323 

Finished. 
Longest sequence is : 323 
```
